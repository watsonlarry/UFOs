# UFOs

## Overview

We've been tasked with building a webpage to support Investigative Journalist Dana's newest subject of interest: UFO sightings. Our primary focus will be to implement a table to collect and filter all the UFO sighting data.

We've built a simple webpage to ease the perusal of our collected UFO data.  By entering search terms into the appropriate boxes (our options: date, city, state, country, and shape) one can filter the data to narrow the results. One need only enter the search term, a button click is not needed to initiate the filtering.

### Summary

The primary drawback to how this website is the specificity of the search function. To retrieve desired data, one must enter a value exactly as it appears in the data table. For example one must enter "st. louis" to view recorded sightings in that city, entering a correctly capitalized "St. Louis" will achieve no results. To improve the site I recommend improving the search function to accommodate alternative spellings. Implementing a drop-down menu could be an option to limit the possibility of a user entering an invalid search term. I also recommend expanding the filter areas to include "duration" and "keyword". The Keyword filter would allow us to search for common words used in the tables "comments"--perhaps finding multiple instances of similarly defined phenomena.
